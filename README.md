# Spectral Analysis of Runoff Data

 Note:
 (Can basically be used on anything, identify patterns in Stock volatility, Monthly Bitcoin values as well)
 
This repository contains a Python script that performs **spectral analysis** on time series data using the **Fourier series method**. 

## Features
- Computes harmonic amplitudes, phase angles, and variance contribution.
- Displays a detailed analysis table.
- Plots a line spectrum (variance spectrum / periodogram).
